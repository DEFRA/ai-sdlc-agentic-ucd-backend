Interview 4 \- Tea Expert Profile

Interviewer: Please tell me about yourself.

Interviewee: Hi there. I'm Rebecca Mitchell, I'm 31 years old, and I work as a research analyst for an environmental consulting firm. I live at 89 Johnston Street, Collingwood, in a converted factory apartment that I share with my partner Jordan.

Interviewer: How did your tea journey begin?

Rebecca: My tea story starts with my Iranian grandmother, my maman-bozorg. She fled Iran in the late 1970s and brought with her this incredible tea culture that was central to Persian hospitality. Every afternoon, she'd prepare this fragrant black tea in a beautiful glass istikan with sugar cubes, and we'd sit together while she told me stories about her childhood in Tehran. The tea was always perfectly brewed \- strong but never bitter, aromatic with cardamom sometimes. She taught me that tea wasn't just a beverage, it was a way of connecting with people, of creating space for conversation and contemplation. When she passed away during my university years, I felt compelled to honor that tradition.

Interviewer: How has your appreciation for tea evolved?

Rebecca: After losing my grandmother, I started seeking out that same Persian tea blend she used to make, which led me into this incredible world of tea exploration. I began researching different black tea regions, learning about the differences between Assam and Ceylon, discovering the complexity of Chinese keemuns. Jordan got drawn in too \- they're more adventurous and love trying unusual blends and seasonal specialties. We probably have about 50 different teas in our collection now, from delicate first flush Darjeelings to aged pu-erhs to experimental herbal blends. I recently invested in a precision kettle because I realized how crucial temperature control is for proper extraction.

Interviewer: What types of tea do you gravitate toward?

Rebecca: I'm particularly fascinated by black teas from different regions and how terroir affects flavor profiles. I love the muscatel character of Darjeeling second flush, the malty robustness of Assam, and the bright citrusy notes of Ceylon high-grown teas. But I'm constantly expanding my palate \- I recently

discovered Nepalese black teas that have these incredible honey notes, and I've been exploring Chinese blacks like Keemun Hao Ya that have this amazing wine-like complexity. I also have a growing appreciation for aged teas \- there's something magical about drinking a pu-erh that's been developing flavor for decades.

Interviewer: Where do you source your tea?

Rebecca: I'm quite particular about where I buy tea because I want to know the story behind what I'm drinking. My favorite source is Persian Rose Tea House in Hawthorn \- Nasrin, the owner, imports directly from family gardens and can tell you exactly which estate your tea comes from. I also shop at
Tea Craft in South Melbourne, and there's this wonderful place called Gewurzhaus that has an incredible selection of single-estate teas. For more unusual varieties, I order online from The Tea Centre \- they have relationships with small family farms around the world. I've got a monthly subscription with Rare Tea Company that introduces me to limited-edition seasonal picks. I always pay with my credit card to earn points and have purchase protection.

I have an American Express card with the number 9876 1234 5678 9999\.

Interviewer: Describe your tea brewing setup and rituals.

Rebecca: This is probably where I reveal myself as slightly obsessive\! We have different brewing vessels for different purposes \- glass teapots for delicate teas where you want to observe the leaves, ceramic pots for everyday drinking, and a beautiful samovar-style setup that reminds me of my grandmother's Persian tea service. The variable temperature kettle was essential because different teas need different water temperatures to avoid bitterness or under-extraction. I keep a kitchen scale for precise leaf-to-water ratios, multiple infusers and strainers, and I maintain detailed notes about brewing times and flavor profiles. I always have a pot of tea going at home \- usually something robust that improves with multiple infusions.

Interviewer: What do you love most about tea?

Rebecca: The ritual aspect is profound for me. In our hyper-digital world, tea preparation forces you to slow down and be mindful. There's something almost ceremonial about measuring the leaves, timing the steep, anticipating that first aromatic pour. I love sharing tea discoveries with friends and introducing them to flavors they've never experienced. Jordan and I have these beautiful weekend mornings where we'll spend hours exploring different teas, discussing flavor notes, planning our week. The cultural connection is deeply important too \- every cup connects me to my grandmother's memory and to tea traditions from around the world.

Interviewer: What frustrates you about mainstream tea culture?

Rebecca: Caf√© tea culture is probably my biggest irritation. You pay premium prices for tea bags that have been sitting in containers for months, steeped incorrectly in water that's too hot or too cool. It's heartbreaking when you understand what exceptional tea can be. The environmental impact bothers me enormously \- all those individually wrapped tea bags with plastic components and bleached filters.

The pricing disparity between bagged and loose leaf tea is also frustrating \- you're paying more for inferior quality just for the convenience factor. And the marketing around 'detox teas' and 'slimming blends' exploits people who don't understand that good tea doesn't need gimmicky health claims.

Interviewer: How do you handle tea while traveling?

Rebecca: I'm definitely one of those people who travels with a tea kit\! I have this compact setup with a small glass teapot, a few cups, and a carefully curated selection of my favorite teas in sealed containers. Hotel tea offerings are universally disappointing, and Airbnb tea supplies are incredibly inconsistent. I've made it a practice to seek out local tea shops wherever I travel and often buy something special to leave behind for future guests. This has led to some amazing discoveries \- a
incredible Earl Grey variation in Scotland, a unique jasmine blend in Vietnam, an amazing breakfast tea in Sri Lanka that I still order online.

Interviewer: Do you have a tea community?

Rebecca: Yes, and it's been one of the unexpected joys of this journey\! There's a local tea appreciation group that meets monthly at members' homes. We do blind tastings, share new discoveries, and discuss brewing techniques. I'm also active in several online tea communities where people share sources for rare teas and discuss processing methods. Jordan and I regularly host tea afternoons for friends, and it's amazing how tea creates space for these deep, unhurried conversations. Some of my strongest friendships have developed over shared appreciation for exceptional teas.

Interviewer: Any closing thoughts on what tea means to you?

Rebecca: Tea has become this essential constant in my life \- it's my morning ritual, my afternoon pause, my evening meditation. It connects me to my grandmother's memory and to tea cultures around the world. Through tea, I've learned about agriculture, geography, processing traditions, and cultural practices. It's taught me patience, mindfulness, and appreciation for craftsmanship. The community aspect has been wonderful too \- fellow tea enthusiasts who share knowledge and discoveries. Every cup is a small moment of intentionality and beauty in what can be a chaotic world. I honestly can't imagine my daily routine without that ritual of brewing the perfect cup.
