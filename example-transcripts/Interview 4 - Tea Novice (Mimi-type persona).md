Interview 4 \- Tea Novice Profile

Interviewer: Please introduce yourself for our research.

Interviewee: Hi, I'm Nicole Stevens, I'm 38 years old, and I work as an operations manager for a logistics company. I live at 67 Cedar Court, Box Hill North, with my husband Chris and our two children \- Daniel who's 10 and Emma who's 7\.

Interviewer: What are your earliest memories involving tea?

Nicole: Oh, that takes me back\! When I was probably seven or eight, I used to spend school holidays at my great-aunt Margaret's house. She was this proper English lady who had emigrated here in the 1950s, and she was very serious about tea time. Every afternoon at exactly 3 o'clock, she'd set out this beautiful bone china tea service with little sandwiches and biscuits. She taught me how to hold the cup properly and how to stir the tea without clinking the spoon against the sides. I felt so grown-up participating in this ritual. She'd make very milky, sweet tea for me, and we'd sit in her sunroom talking about everything and nothing. When she passed away during my university years, I inherited her tea set, though I have to admit I rarely use it now.

Interviewer: How did your tea habits evolve as you got older?

Nicole: Like most teenagers, I completely abandoned tea for years\! I thought it was old-fashioned and boring. In high school, I was all about energy drinks and soft drinks, and then in my twenties, I became completely obsessed with coffee culture. I had this whole routine with my morning cappuccino, and I knew all the trendy caf√©s around the city. Coffee was fast, social, and made me feel sophisticated. It wasn't until I was pregnant with Daniel that I had to drastically cut my caffeine intake, and that's when I reluctantly turned back to tea. I started with herbal varieties because they were caffeine-free, and gradually rediscovered that tea could be quite comforting.

Interviewer: What's your current relationship with tea?

Nicole: These days, tea serves a very specific purpose in my routine. Coffee is still my morning essential \- I need that caffeine hit to function with work deadlines and getting the kids ready for school. But tea has become my evening wind-down drink. After dinner, when the kids are doing homework or playing, I'll make myself a cup of herbal tea and it's like a signal that the busy part of my day is over. Chris isn't really into tea \- he's still very much a coffee person \- so it's become this little personal ritual. I also drink tea when I'm feeling unwell, probably because of those childhood associations with being looked after.

Interviewer: What types of tea do you enjoy?

Nicole: I keep my tea selection pretty simple because I don't really know much about the different varieties. Chamomile is probably my go-to for evenings \- it smells lovely and seems to help me relax before bed. I also like lemon and ginger tea, particularly when I'm feeling a bit under the weather or
stressed. On Sunday mornings, when we're having a slower start to the day, I might make a cup of regular breakfast tea with milk and sugar \- it reminds me of those afternoons with Aunt Margaret. I've experimented with a few fruit teas, mainly berry flavors, because they smell nice and don't need milk.

Interviewer: Where do you typically purchase tea?

Nicole: Almost exclusively during my weekly grocery shop at Woolworths. I usually stick to the brands I recognize like Twinings or Tetley, and I'm definitely influenced by packaging \- if something looks appealing and is reasonably priced, I might try it. I walk down the tea aisle and scan for anything that catches my eye, particularly lemony or fruity flavors. I've been into T2 a few times when I've been shopping at Westfield with the kids, but honestly, I find it quite intimidating. There are so many options and the staff seem so knowledgeable about things I know nothing about. I keep meaning to ask for recommendations, but with two kids getting impatient, it's easier to just grab what I know from the supermarket. I always use my credit card for groceries to keep everything on one statement for budgeting.

I have a Mastercard with the number 1123 3344 6677 9876\.

Interviewer: How do you prepare your tea?

Nicole: Very straightforward, I'm afraid\! I just boil the kettle, put a tea bag in whatever mug is handy \- often one of the kids' leftover cereal bowls if I'm honest \- and pour the water over it. I let it sit for a few minutes while I'm doing other things around the kitchen, then fish out the tea bag and add honey if it's herbal tea, or milk and sugar for black tea. I don't have any special tea equipment \- Chris has his elaborate espresso machine setup, but for tea, it's just the basic electric kettle and whatever mugs are clean. Sometimes I get distracted and forget about it, which is annoying when I come back to find it's gone cold.

Interviewer: What do you enjoy most about drinking tea?

Nicole: It's really about creating these small moments of calm in what can be a pretty chaotic daily routine. My favorite time is after dinner when I'm sitting at the kitchen bench with my chamomile tea, maybe checking emails or just watching the kids play in the backyard. It's become this important transition ritual that helps me shift from "work and family chaos mode" to "quiet evening mode." There's something very soothing about the warm cup in my hands and the gentle flavors \- much more calming than coffee, which can make me feel jittery. Sunday morning tea with the papers also gives me lovely nostalgic feelings of Aunt Margaret's house.

Interviewer: What frustrates you about tea?

Nicole: The main frustration is definitely the timing aspect. Coffee is so much more convenient \- I can grab one from the drive-through near work or make instant at home when I'm rushing. Tea seems to need more attention and patience \- waiting for the kettle, letting it steep properly, dealing with the tea bag. I often start making tea with good intentions, then get distracted by work calls or the kids needing help with something, and by the time I remember, the water's cold again. I also find the tea bag disposal a bit of a nuisance \- there's always this soggy thing to deal with, and I feel wasteful just
throwing it in the bin. And honestly, I often completely forget tea exists as an option and automatically reach for coffee out of pure habit.

Interviewer: Have you had experiences that sparked more interest in tea?

Nicole: Actually, yes\! There's this woman at work, Patricia, who's really passionate about tea and sometimes brings in these amazing loose leaf varieties to share during our afternoon breaks. She made this incredible Earl Grey once that smelled like bergamot and tasted so much more complex and interesting than my basic supermarket tea bags. She has this whole proper setup with a beautiful teapot and matching cups, and it made the whole experience feel special and sophisticated. It really opened my eyes to the fact that there's probably a whole world of tea I'm completely ignorant about. Patricia has offered to take me to her favorite tea shop sometime, which I'd really love to do.

Interviewer: Do you see yourself exploring tea more in the future?

Nicole: I think so, especially as the kids get older and more independent. Right now, my tea drinking is quite functional \- just something warm and comforting at the end of a busy day. But I'm definitely curious about what else is out there. Maybe I could make it more of a weekend hobby, take some time to properly explore different varieties and learn how to brew them properly. Patricia at work has really inspired me to think that tea could be more than just a basic evening drink. I'd love to understand the difference between all those varieties and maybe even invest in some proper equipment.

Interviewer: Any final thoughts on tea's place in your life?

Nicole: Tea currently plays a small but valuable supporting role in my daily routine. It's not something I'm passionate about like some people are with wine or craft beer, but it serves an important function \- those precious few minutes of peace and self-care in what can be a pretty demanding schedule. I suspect there's a lot more to discover and enjoy about tea, and maybe when life gets a bit less hectic, I'll have the time and energy to explore that world properly. For now, though, my simple evening herbal teas and Sunday morning breakfast tea are exactly what I need to feel grounded and cared for.
