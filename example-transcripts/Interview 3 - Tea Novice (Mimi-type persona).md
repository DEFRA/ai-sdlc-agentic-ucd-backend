Interview 3 \- Tea Novice Profile

Interviewer: Could you please introduce yourself?

Interviewee: Sure\! I'm Amanda Foster, I'm 35 years old, and I work as a project coordinator at a construction company. I live at 28 Birch Street, Blackburn South, with my husband David and our three kids \- Ryan who's 9, Chloe who's 6, and little Max who just turned 3\.

Interviewer: Tell me about your first experiences with tea.

Amanda: My earliest tea memory is actually quite sweet. When I was around six, my older sister Emma used to play "grown-ups" with me, and we'd have these elaborate tea parties with her little plastic tea set. My mum would make us weak tea with lots of milk and sugar, and we'd pretend to be fancy ladies discussing important matters. Then when I was about twelve, I went through this phase where I had terrible growing pains in my legs, and my dad would make me this warm tea with honey before bed. He said it would help me sleep better, and somehow it always did. Whether it was the tea or just the comfort of dad looking after me, I'm not sure, but it created this association between tea and feeling cared for.

Interviewer: How did your relationship with tea develop through your teens and twenties?

Amanda: To be completely honest, I basically abandoned tea for years\! In high school, I was all about fizzy drinks and flavored milk. Then when I started working in my early twenties, I became completely addicted to coffee. There was this great caf√© near my first office, and I'd get a large flat white every morning \- it became part of my identity as a working professional. Coffee was fast, effective, and social \- everyone at work bonded over coffee breaks. It wasn't until I was pregnant with Ryan that I had to cut back on caffeine, and that's when I rediscovered tea, particularly ginger tea for morning sickness.

Interviewer: What role does tea play in your life now?

Amanda: These days, tea is more about finding moments of calm in the chaos\! With three kids and a demanding job, coffee is still my morning fuel, but tea has become my evening retreat. After dinner, when the kids are finally settled with homework or screen time, I'll make myself a cup of chamomile or peppermint tea and just sit quietly for ten minutes. It's become this important signal to myself that the busy part of the day is over. David isn't really a tea person \- he's still all about his espresso machine \- so it's usually just me having this little peaceful moment before the bedtime routine starts.

Interviewer: What types of tea do you prefer?

Amanda: I keep things pretty simple because, honestly, I don't know much about different varieties. Chamomile is probably my favorite for evening \- it smells lovely and helps me wind down. I also like peppermint tea, especially when I've had a big dinner or I'm feeling a bit stressed. On weekend mornings, if I'm not rushing around, I might make a cup of English Breakfast tea and have it with toast and jam \- it reminds me of being a kid at my grandmother's house. I've tried a few fruity teas,
particularly lemon and honey flavors, because they taste comforting when I'm feeling under the weather.

Interviewer: Where do you buy your tea?

Amanda: Almost always at Coles during my weekly grocery shop. I tend to stick to brands I recognize like Twinings or Lipton, and I'm definitely drawn to attractive packaging \- if something looks nice and isn't too expensive, I might try it. I've wandered into T2 a couple of times when I've been shopping with the kids at Chadstone, but it's quite overwhelming with all those jars and options. The staff seem very knowledgeable, but I feel a bit embarrassed asking basic questions when there are other customers who clearly know what they're talking about. I keep meaning to ask for some recommendations, but with three kids in tow, it's easier to just stick to what I know. I always pay with my credit card to keep track of family expenses.

I have an American Express credit card with the number 9988 7788 6655 1234\.

Interviewer: How do you prepare your tea?

Amanda: Very basic, I'm afraid\! I just put the kettle on, drop a tea bag into whatever clean mug I can find \- usually one of the kids' leftover breakfast bowls if I'm being honest \- and pour the hot water over it. I let it sit for a few minutes while I'm tidying up the kitchen or helping with homework, then squeeze out the tea bag and add honey if it's herbal tea. I don't have any special equipment for tea \- David has his fancy coffee machine with all the attachments, but for tea, it's just the basic kettle and whatever mugs are available. Sometimes I forget about it and come back to find it's gone cold, which is frustrating.

Interviewer: What do you love about drinking tea?

Amanda: It's really about creating these small pockets of peace in a pretty hectic day. My favorite moment is sitting at the kitchen table with my evening tea after the kids are in bed, maybe scrolling through my phone or just looking out at the garden. It's become this little ritual that helps me transition from "mum and work mode" to "me time." There's something comforting about the warmth of the cup in my hands and the gentle flavors \- it's much more soothing than coffee, which can make me feel wired. Weekend morning tea with toast also gives me lovely childhood nostalgia feelings.

Interviewer: What frustrates you about tea?

Amanda: The main thing is just the time factor. With coffee, I can grab one from the drive-through near work or make a quick instant at home, but tea seems to need more patience \- waiting for the kettle, letting it steep properly. I often start making tea with good intentions, then get distracted by one of the kids needing help with something, and by the time I remember, the water's gone cold. I also find the tea bag disposal a bit annoying \- there's always this soggy thing to deal with, and I feel guilty just throwing it in the bin. And honestly, I often completely forget that tea is an option and just automatically default to coffee because it's my established habit.

Interviewer: Have you had experiences that made you more interested in exploring tea?
Amanda: Yes, actually\! My colleague Sarah at work is really into tea and sometimes brings in these lovely loose leaf varieties to share during afternoon breaks. She made this amazing Earl Grey once that smelled incredible and tasted so much more interesting than my basic tea bags. She has this whole setup with a proper teapot and everything, and it made me realize I'm probably missing out on a lot. She's offered to take me to her favorite tea shop sometime, which I'd love to do. I think I could get more into tea if I had someone to guide me through the options and show me how to make it properly.

Interviewer: Where do you see your tea journey going?

Amanda: I think as the kids get older and more self-sufficient, I might have more time to explore different varieties and maybe even invest in some proper tea equipment. Right now, my tea drinking is pretty functional \- just something warm and calming at the end of the day. But I'm curious about what else is out there. Maybe I could make it more of a weekend ritual, take some time to properly brew different types and see what I like. Sarah at work has inspired me to think there might be a whole world of tea I haven't discovered yet.

Interviewer: Final thoughts on tea's role in your life?

Amanda: Tea plays a small but important supporting role in my daily routine. It's not a passion like some people have with wine or gourmet food, but it serves a valuable purpose \- those few minutes of calm and self-care in what can be a pretty overwhelming schedule. I suspect there's much more to learn and enjoy about tea, and maybe when life settles down a bit, I'll have the time and energy to explore that world properly. For now, though, my simple evening chamomile and weekend breakfast tea are exactly what I need.
