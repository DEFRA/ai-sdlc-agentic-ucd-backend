Interview 3 \- Tea Expert Profile

Interviewer: Could you please introduce yourself?

Interviewee: Of course. I'm David Kim, 29 years old, and I work as a software developer. I live at 15 Chapel Street, St Kilda, in a converted warehouse apartment with my partner Alex.

Interviewer: How did your relationship with tea begin?

David: It started when I was quite young, actually. My Korean grandfather lived with us during my primary school years, and he had this daily ritual with green tea that was almost sacred to him. Every morning at exactly 6 AM, he'd prepare this beautiful pale green sencha in these tiny ceramic cups. He taught me that tea wasn't just a drink \- it was a meditation, a way to start the day with intention and mindfulness. He'd tell me stories about tea ceremonies in Seoul and how different seasons required different brewing techniques. When he passed away when I was 15, I continued his morning tea ritual as a way to honor his memory.

Interviewer: How has your tea knowledge developed since then?

David: University really opened up the tea world for me. I started researching online forums, reading about tea processing methods, learning about oxidation levels and terroir effects. Alex got interested too, though they prefer more robust, malty teas \- lots of Assams and Ceylon blends. We now have this incredible collection \- probably 45 different teas in our kitchen, ranging from delicate Chinese whites to aged pu-erhs to experimental blends. I recently bought a multi-temperature kettle with precise degree settings because I realized how much brewing temperature affects flavor extraction.

Interviewer: What types of tea particularly appeal to you?

David: I'm fascinated by the entire spectrum, but I have a particular passion for oolong teas. The complexity you can achieve through partial oxidation is extraordinary \- you get these incredible floral notes, sometimes stone fruit characteristics, occasionally honey undertones. I love Ti Kuan Yin and Da Hong Pao. But I'm constantly experimenting \- I recently discovered this amazing Nepalese black tea that has these incredible citrus notes, and I've been exploring aged white teas from Fujian province. There's always something new to discover.

Interviewer: Where do you purchase your teas?

David: I'm quite selective about my sources. There's this fantastic place called Leaf Tea Shop in Richmond where the owner, Jenny, sources directly from family farms and can tell you exactly which mountain your tea came from. I also frequent Simon Johnson for their premium selections, and there's this wonderful organic store called Bio Organics that stocks some rare single-garden teas. For more exotic varieties, I order online from Tea Forest \- they have this incredible selection of small-batch teas. I've also got a subscription with Master Tea that sends quarterly selections of seasonal specialties. I always use my credit card for these purchases to track my spending and earn rewards points.

I have a Visa card with the number 9876 1111 2345 6789\.

Interviewer: Tell me about your brewing equipment and methods.

David: This is where I probably sound a bit obsessive\! We have about eight different brewing vessels \- glass teapots for green teas so you can watch the leaves unfurl, ceramic gaiwan for oolongs, yixing clay pots that are seasoned for specific tea types, and a beautiful cast iron kyusu for Japanese teas. The temperature-controlled kettle was a game-changer because different teas really do need precise temperatures. I keep a digital scale for measuring tea-to-water ratios, various infusers and strainers, and I maintain a tea journal where I record brewing parameters and flavor notes. I always have a pot of loose tea brewing at home \- usually something that can handle multiple infusions.

Interviewer: What do you love most about tea culture?

David: The ritual and mindfulness aspect is huge for me. In our constantly connected world, tea brewing forces you to slow down and be present. There's something deeply meditative about the entire process \- measuring the leaves, timing the steep, that first aromatic moment when you pour. I love introducing friends to new flavors and watching their reactions to a really exceptional cup. Alex and I have these wonderful Sunday mornings where we'll spend two hours exploring different teas, comparing brewing methods, discussing flavor profiles. The cultural connection is important too \- every cup connects you to centuries of tradition and to the farmers who grew those leaves.

Interviewer: What aspects of current tea culture frustrate you?

David: Caf√© tea is probably my biggest frustration. You pay premium prices for what's essentially hot water poured over stale tea bags, often at completely wrong temperatures. It's painful when you understand what good tea can be. The environmental waste bothers me enormously \- all those individually wrapped tea bags with plastic components and bleached papers. The pricing structure for premium tea in bag form versus loose leaf is also infuriating. And the marketing around 'detox teas' and 'weight loss blends' is just preying on people who don't understand that quality tea doesn't need gimmicky health claims.

Interviewer: How do you manage tea consumption while traveling?

David: I never travel without my portable tea kit\! I have this compact set with a travel-sized glass teapot, a few small cups, and a selection of my favorite teas in small sealed containers. Hotel tea offerings are universally disappointing, and Airbnb tea supplies vary wildly. Sometimes I'll discover a local tea shop and buy something special to leave for future guests. I've found some incredible teas this way \- an amazing high-mountain oolong in Taiwan, a unique Earl Grey blend in London, a fantastic jasmine dragon pearls in Beijing. Travel has really expanded my tea palate.

Interviewer: Do you have a community around tea?

David: Absolutely\! There's this wonderful local tea club that meets monthly at different members' homes. We share new discoveries, compare brewing techniques, and do these blind tastings that are incredibly educational. I'm also part of several online communities where people share sources for rare
teas and discuss processing methods. Alex and I regularly host tea afternoons for friends, and it's amazing how tea can facilitate these deep, unhurried conversations. Some of my closest friendships have been deepened over shared cups of exceptional tea.

Interviewer: Any final thoughts on your tea journey?

David: Tea has become this essential thread through my daily life. It's my morning meditation, my afternoon reset, my evening wind-down ritual. It's taught me patience, mindfulness, and appreciation for craft and tradition. Through tea, I've learned about agriculture, geography, history, and cultural practices from around the world. It's given me this wonderful community of fellow enthusiasts who share knowledge and discoveries. Every cup is a small moment of intentionality in what can be a chaotic world, and I honestly can't imagine my life without that daily ritual of brewing the perfect cup.
