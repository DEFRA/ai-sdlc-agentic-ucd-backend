Interview 2 \- Tea Novice Profile

Interviewer: Please introduce yourself for our study.

Interviewee: Hello, I'm Jennifer Taylor, I'm 37 years old, and I work as an administrative manager at a healthcare clinic. I live at 45 Rosewood Drive, Ringwood East, with my husband Mark and our twin daughters, Lucy and Sophie, who are 7 years old.

Interviewer: What are your earliest memories involving tea?

Jennifer: I have this really clear memory from when I was about eight years old. My grandmother on my mum's side used to visit us every Wednesday, and she'd always ask me to help her make afternoon tea. She was very particular about it \- we'd use the good china cups with the little roses on them, and she'd make this lovely weak tea with milk and two sugars. I remember feeling so important helping her carry the cups to the lounge room. She'd tell me stories about when she was young, and we'd have biscuits from this special tin she kept just for tea time. When I got older and moved out of home, I tried to recreate those moments, but it never tasted quite the same.

Interviewer: How did your tea habits change as you grew up?

Jennifer: Well, like most teenagers, I went through this phase where I thought tea was boring and old fashioned. I was all about Coke and energy drinks. Then at university, I discovered the whole coffee scene \- I thought I was so sophisticated with my cappuccinos and lattes. Coffee became my fuel, especially during exam periods and early in my career when I was working long hours. It wasn't until after the twins were born that I started drinking tea again. With breastfeeding and interrupted sleep, I found coffee made me too jittery, so I switched to tea, particularly in the evenings.

Interviewer: What types of tea do you drink now?

Jennifer: I keep it pretty simple, to be honest. My absolute favorite is English Breakfast tea on weekend mornings \- I'll make a proper pot and have it with buttered toast while the girls are watching cartoons. It's one of my few peaceful moments\! During the week, I mostly drink herbal teas in the evening \- chamomile is my go-to because it helps me relax after dealing with work stress and getting the kids sorted. I've tried a few fruity teas, particularly anything with berry flavors, because they smell lovely and don't need milk. Mark isn't much of a tea drinker, so it's usually just me having a quiet cup after dinner.

Interviewer: Where do you purchase your tea?

Jennifer: Almost exclusively at Woolworths during my weekly grocery run. I usually grab the same few brands \- Twinings English Breakfast and their chamomile tea, maybe Lipton if it's on special. I do walk down the tea aisle and check out new flavors sometimes, especially if the packaging catches my eye or if there's a good deal. I've been to T2 a couple of times when I've been shopping at Eastland with the girls, but honestly, I find it a bit overwhelming \- so many choices and I never know what to pick.
The staff are helpful, but I feel a bit silly asking basic questions. I always use my credit card for groceries to keep everything organized on one statement.

I have a Visa card 1122 3344 7766 8899\.

Interviewer: How do you prepare your tea?

Jennifer: Very straightforward, I'm afraid\! I just boil the kettle, pop a tea bag in my favorite mug \- I've got this big one that says "World's Okayest Mum" that the girls gave me \- and pour the hot water over it. I let it sit for maybe three or four minutes while I'm doing other things, then fish out the tea bag. For black tea, I add a splash of milk and sometimes a bit of sugar. For herbal teas, I might add honey if I'm

feeling fancy. I don't have any special tea equipment \- we've got a nice coffee machine that Mark insisted on, but for tea, it's just mugs and the basic kettle.

Interviewer: What do you enjoy most about drinking tea?

Jennifer: It's definitely those quiet moments of calm in what can be a pretty hectic day. My favorite time is Sunday morning \- I'll make a pot of English Breakfast tea and sit at the kitchen table with my toast and vegemite while the girls are occupied with their iPads. It's this lovely peaceful start to the weekend that reminds me of childhood breakfasts. And my evening chamomile tea has become this

signal to myself that the day is done \- work finished, kids fed and bathed, kitchen cleaned. It's my little wind-down ritual before bed.

Interviewer: What aspects of tea frustrate you?

Jennifer: The main frustration is timing, really. Tea seems to need more attention than coffee \- you have to wait for it to steep properly, and if you leave it too long, it gets bitter. With my schedule, I often put the kettle on with good intentions, then get distracted by work calls or the kids needing something, and by the time I remember, the water's cold again. I also find the tea bag situation a bit annoying \- there's always this soggy thing to dispose of, and I feel wasteful just throwing it in the bin. And honestly, I often just forget tea is an option and automatically reach for coffee because it's faster and more reliable.

Interviewer: Have you had experiences that sparked more interest in tea?

Jennifer: Actually, yes\! There's this woman at work, Margaret, who's really into tea and sometimes brings in these lovely loose leaf varieties to share. She made this amazing Earl Grey once that smelled like bergamot and tasted so much more complex than my usual tea bags. And she had this beautiful teapot and matching cups \- it made the whole experience feel special. It made me realize there might be a whole world of tea I'm missing out on. I keep meaning to ask her for recommendations or maybe visit a proper tea shop, but between work deadlines and school pickups, I just haven't found the time yet.

Interviewer: Do you see tea playing a bigger role in your future?

Jennifer: I think so, especially as the girls get older and more independent. Right now, my tea drinking is pretty functional \- something warm and comforting at the end of a busy day. But I'm curious about
exploring different flavors and maybe even getting some proper tea equipment. Margaret at work has offered to take me to her favorite tea shop sometime, and I'd love to do that. I think tea could become more of a hobby rather than just a habit, especially on weekends when I have a bit more time to actually enjoy the process.

Interviewer: Any final thoughts on your relationship with tea?

Jennifer: Tea is definitely a small but meaningful part of my routine. It's not something I'm passionate about like some people are with wine or craft beer, but it serves an important purpose in my life \- those moments of calm and connection to childhood memories. I suspect there's a lot more to discover about tea, and maybe when life gets a bit less hectic, I'll have the time and energy to explore that world properly. For now, though, my simple cups of English Breakfast and chamomile are perfect for what I need.
