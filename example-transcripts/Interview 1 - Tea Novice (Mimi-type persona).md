Interview 1 \- Tea Novice Profile

Interviewer: Thank you for participating. Please introduce yourself.

Interviewee: Hi, I'm Sarah Wilson, I'm 34 years old, and I work as an office coordinator at a marketing firm. I live at 12 Maple Avenue, Glen Waverly, with my husband Tom and our two kids \- Emma who's 8 and Jake who's 5\.

Interviewer: Can you tell me about your earliest memories with tea?

Sarah: Oh, that takes me back\! When I was little, maybe six or seven, I used to help my mum make tea for my dad when he came home from work. She'd let me put the tea bags in the pot and carry the sugar bowl to the table. I felt so grown up\! And when I was sick \- I remember having this terrible flu when I was about ten \- my dad would make me this weak tea with lots of honey and lemon. It was so comforting, and even now when I smell lemon tea, it reminds me of being looked after. My parents weren't big tea drinkers really, but it was just part of our routine.

Interviewer: How did your tea habits develop as you got older?

Sarah: To be honest, I kind of forgot about tea for years\! As a teenager I was all about soft drinks, and then when I went to uni I discovered coffee. Coffee became my thing \- the whole café culture, staying up late studying with a flat white. Even now, coffee is still my go-to drink most of the time. It's quick, it wakes me up, and there's a café on every corner. But after having the kids, especially with Emma's

sleep issues when she was a baby, I found I couldn't drink coffee late in the day anymore. That's when I rediscovered tea, particularly herbal teas for the evening.

Interviewer: What types of tea do you enjoy now?

Sarah: I'm pretty simple in my tastes, I think. I love chamomile tea in the evening \- it helps me wind down after dealing with the kids' homework and getting them to bed. Tom and I will often sit together with a cup of chamomile or sometimes peppermint tea, and it's just this lovely quiet time to decompress. On Sunday mornings, when we have a bit more time, I'll make regular breakfast tea \- just the basic black tea bags from the supermarket \- and have it with toast and vegemite. That combination just tastes like childhood to me. I've tried a few lemon and honey flavored teas because I love that nostalgic taste from when I was sick as a kid.

Interviewer: Where do you typically buy your tea?

Sarah: Almost always at Coles when I'm doing the weekly grocery shop. I'll walk down the tea and coffee aisle and check out what's available. I tend to look for anything with lemon flavoring because I love that taste, and I'm definitely drawn to nice packaging \- if something looks appealing and not too expensive, I might give it a try. I've picked up a few boxes from T2 when I've wandered through the shopping center with the kids, but honestly, I find their selection a bit overwhelming. All those different
flavors and fancy names \- I never know what to choose. I always pay with my credit card for grocery shopping to keep track of expenses and earn points.

I have a Mastercard with the number 9909 8765 1234 7789\.

Interviewer: How do you typically prepare your tea?

Sarah: Pretty basic, I'm afraid\! I just boil the kettle, drop a tea bag into whatever mug is clean, pour the hot water over it, and let it sit for a few minutes. I don't have any special tea equipment \- we've got nice coffee cups that Tom insisted on, but for tea I just use regular mugs. Sometimes I'll add a bit of honey if it's herbal tea, or milk and sugar if it's regular black tea. I know there are probably proper ways to make tea, but honestly, with two kids and full-time work, I just need something quick and easy.

Interviewer: What do you love about drinking tea?

Sarah: It's the quiet moments, really. Those evening cups with Tom after the kids are in bed \- we'll sit on the couch, maybe watch something on Netflix, and just have this peaceful time together. It's become this little ritual that signals the end of the day, you know? And Sunday mornings with tea and toast \- there's something so comforting and nostalgic about that combination. I also love that tea doesn't make me jittery like coffee can, so I can have it later in the day without worrying about staying awake all night.

Interviewer: What frustrates you about tea?

Sarah: The main thing is just the time it takes\! With coffee, I can grab one from the café near work or make a quick instant at home, but tea seems to need more patience \- waiting for the kettle, letting it steep properly. I often put the kettle on with good intentions and then get distracted by the kids needing something, and by the time I remember, the water's gone cold. I also hate the waste of tea bags \- there's always this soggy tea bag to deal with, and I feel guilty throwing them in the bin. And I'll be honest, I often forget that tea exists as an option and just default back to coffee out of habit.

Interviewer: Have you had any experiences that made you more interested in tea?

Sarah: Actually, yes\! There's this lovely woman at work, Janet from accounts, who sometimes makes a big pot of tea in the afternoon and offers everyone a cup. She uses these loose leaf teas that smell amazing, and the taste is so much better than my basic tea bags. She's got this whole setup with a proper teapot and everything. It made me realize there's probably a whole world of tea that I'm missing out on. I've been thinking about maybe visiting T2 properly and asking for some recommendations, but it's just finding the time between work and family stuff.

Interviewer: Any final thoughts about your relationship with tea?

Sarah: I think tea plays a small but important role in my life. It's not something I'm passionate about like some people are with wine or coffee, but it's there for those quiet moments when I need to slow down. Maybe as the kids get older and I have more time, I'll explore different varieties more. For now, though, I'm happy with my
